# simple-rest-api

A simple RESTful API that simulates a simple Hotel Booking API

This project was made so i could freshen up my skill in REST/CRUD, its simple and to the point.
It utilizes Depedency injection and In-memory database for simplicity, but it will be expanded later to interact with a real DB.

Feel free to take a look.


Steps to Get Started:

- Clone this repo
- `dotnet run` in order to start the web server
- Make requests
- Have fun
- You can also try the xUnit test cases!
